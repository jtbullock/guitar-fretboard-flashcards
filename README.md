# guitar-fretboard-flashcards

Educational tool to help musicians learn notes on a guitar neck. 

Also, a good excuse to play around with Svelte ;)

## Features
* Quizzes the user by note name on a particular string using random  
* User can choose to be quizzed on a single string
* When user chooses to proceed to next card, the note's position is revealed on the guitar neck

## Future Feature Ideas
* Allow configuration for different tunings
* Improve flash card logic to be a little less random  
  * Make sure all notes are quizzed with some regularity
  * More heavily weight missed notes (would require some interesting UI interaction)
* Quiz the user on building triads or chords
* Could be useful simply for visualizing:
  * Scales
  * Everywhere a particular note appears
  * Octaves
